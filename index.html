            <p><strong>Start of it all</strong><p style="font-style: oblique;">4/08/2024</p></p>
                <p>Classes started today. It was my first zoom call ever and I can't lie I was a little nervous. But it went great! Sarah was awesome and patient with all of us.</p>

            <p><strong>First day of Backend</strong><p style="font-style: oblique;">4/15/2024</p></p>
            <p>It's Backend day! I am super excited to start my coding career. We met Travis, the new teacher, last week and he seems cool as hell and just as excited to teach me as I am to learn!</p>

            <p><strong>Reject the Regex</strong><p style="font-style: oblique;">4/24/2024</p></p>
                <p>What the heck did I just learn. Class was going smooth, homeworks were all on time and quizes were doing great but this...this stuff is hard. But I'm not gonna let it get me behind!</p>
